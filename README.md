Stories is a simple way of sharing code snippets with other developers.

## Getting Started

You can download Stories from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=benawad.stories).

Once you have it, you should see something similar to this:

![stories UI](readme-pics/location.png)

You can click the button or open up the panel to access the stories. Once you have that open up, you can click on anyone's profile picture, and you'll be shown a file of what they're currently working on!

To upload your own story, click the Create Story button on the bottom right.
